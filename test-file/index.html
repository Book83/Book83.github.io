        <p> This was a day when we went to Kota Casablanka 
            and thought that it was our first visit. 
            But turns out it was our second visit. 
            Here are the dishes we have tried on that day:</p>
            <ul> 
                <li> thai soup</li>
                <li> plain rice</li>
                <li> cheesy chicken</li>
            </ul>
